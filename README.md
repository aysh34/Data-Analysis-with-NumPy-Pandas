# Mastering Data Analysis with NumPy & Pandas!

## **About This Project**  
In this hands-on project, I explored the **fundamentals of data analysis in Python**, leveraging the power of two essential libraries: **NumPy & Pandas**. These libraries are at the core of **Data Science & Machine Learning**, providing **high-performance data structures & powerful analysis tools**.  

## **Key Highlights of the Project**  

### ‚úÖ NumPy for Numerical Computations  
- Creating & manipulating arrays  
- Applying mathematical operations on financial data  
- Using conditional selections for data filtering  

### ‚úÖ Pandas for Data Wrangling  
- Creating & managing structured datasets (DataFrames)  
- Merging, concatenating, and transforming data  
- Applying custom functions for financial insights
